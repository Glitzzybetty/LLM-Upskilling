      "Sure! Chatbots have a fascinating history that dates back to the mid-20th century. The first chatbot, known as ELIZA, was created in the 1960s by Joseph Weizenbaum. ELIZA simulated a conversation by using simple pattern matching techniques. It was designed to imitate a psychotherapist and had the ability to respond to prompts with pre-programmed responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 1970s, PARRY was developed by Kenneth Colby, which simulated a person with paranoid schizophrenia. PARRY attempted to pass the Turing Test, a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another notable chatbot is A.L.I.C.E (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity), created by Richard Wallace in 1995. A.L.I.C.E was designed to win the Loebner Prize, an annual competition that tests the Turing Test. It utilized natural language processing techniques to generate human-like responses.\n",

With the advent of deep learning and neural networks, chatbots can now understand and respond to more complex queries, making them increasingly useful in various industries, including customer service, virtual assistants, and even therapy.\n",
